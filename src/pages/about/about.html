<!--<p>We recognize that in many instances, parenthood is
  viewed as a handicap to an artistic career. We hope to see a
  world in which all writers are are afforded an equal chance – a
  world where the needs of parents are addressed as a matter of
  course when creating an arts-forward service program, as they
  will ultimately be in every career path.
